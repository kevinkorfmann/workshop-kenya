    "Embedding\" is a general term used in machine learning and refers to the process of mapping a high-dimensional, discrete or categorical input into a continuous, low-dimensional vector space (embedding space) where similar inputs are close to each other. In neural networks, embeddings are often learned in an unsupervised manner, meaning that the embedding space is learned from the data itself, without the need for explicit supervision.\n",
    "\n",
    "Embeddings are widely used in natural language processing (NLP) and graph neural networks (GNNs), among other areas. Here are some specific examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "    NLP: In NLP, embeddings are often used to represent words or phrases as vectors in a continuous space, which can capture semantic and syntactic similarities between words. Word embeddings are typically learned by training a neural network to predict a word from its context (i.e., neighboring words), using a technique called Word2Vec. Once learned, these embeddings can be used as input features for downstream NLP tasks, such as sentiment analysis or named entity recognition.\n",
    "\n",
    "    GNNs: In GNNs, embeddings are used to represent nodes or edges in a graph as vectors in a continuous space, which can capture the structural similarities and relationships between them. Graph embeddings are typically learned by training a neural network to predict the presence or absence of edges between nodes in a graph, using techniques such as graph convolutional networks (GCNs) or graph attention networks (GATs). Once learned, these embeddings can be used as input features for downstream GNN tasks, such as node classification or link prediction.\n",
